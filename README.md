# Asset Compare

A delightful app where users can check and compare real time market caps/prices of stocks and crypto assets, on one chart.

## Motivation

Cryptoassets are an emerging market class. As market cap is typically a good indicator of overall "network value", we hope to surprise users with how valuable some of these crypto-networks (such as bitcoin) are becomming, compared to some perceived "too big to fail" comanpies. One of the easiest ways to illustrate that, is a bar chart.
